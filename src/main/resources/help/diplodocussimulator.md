# Diplodocus Simulator

## Objective

The simulator of DIPLODOCUS intends to simulate a DIPLODOCUS mapping, taking into account functional tasks, the system architectures (CPU, buses, etc.) and the allocations of tasks and their communucations to the system architecture


## Generating simulation code and commiling it?

The first step is to create a DIPLODOCUS mapping. Once the mapping model has been checked against syntax errors ![syntax checking icon](file:../ui/util/checkmodel.gif), it is possible to generate a C++ code ![simulation code generation icon](file:../ui/util/gensystc.gif) that represents the mapping model. If you are using a model in TTool, then the code is generated by default in TTool/simulators/c++2 for models. If your model has been made in a project, then the code is generated into the "c++_code" subdirectory of your project.

The second step is to compile the code. You can directly do it from TTool with the code generation window, second tab. Another option is to open a terminal, and to enter the following command:

```
$ make
```
## Using the simulator from TTool

The third tab of the simulation code generation window provides several options to start the simulator, e.g. either running simulation until completion or running the server in interactive mode. For the latter, the simulator is started in server mode, and TTool connects via sockets to the server in order to remotely drive the simulation. 



## Command-line use of the simulation

Once the simulator has been compiled, do as follows to  list possible options:
```
$ ./run.x -help
```
Basically, options are used to express the working mode (```-server```for interactive mode, ```-explo```to generate a reachability graphs, ...), to set the output (e.g., ```-gpath```or finally to set commands to be executed, either from the command line (```-cmd```) or from a file (```-file```). For instance:

```
$ ./run.x -cmd '1 6 100 ; 3 Task1 ; 1 0 ; 3 Task1'
means 'run-to-time 100 ; get-variable-of-task Task1 ; run-to-next-breakpoint ; get-variable-of-task Task1'
(Using the corresponding code instead of the command name when running in command line mode)
```

### Simulator commands

The parameters types are defined as follow:
```
Type = 0: "";
Type = 1: <Int>;
Type = 2: <String>;
Type = 3: [Int];
Type = 4: [String];
Type = 6: [int between 0 and 100 (percentage);
Not defined: <unknow param>
```
