<h1 id="reachability-graphs">Reachability graphs</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-a-reachability-graph">What is a reachability graph?</h2>
<p>A reachability graph (RG) represents all possible execution paths and
states of a system. Here, a reachability graph is produced from an
Avatar design. To be generated, the graph generator considers all
possible transitions from states of states machine, independently from
the probabilities attached to transitions between the states of state
machines. Said differently, the graph generator considers all possible
transitions between states of states machines. So, even transitions with
low probability are in the RG.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-generate-a-reachability-graph">How to generate a
reachability graph?</h2>
<p>Reachability Graphs can be created by using the internal
model-checker of TTool. This video on formal verification details the
steps to generate a RG: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IYJ1UDUbvQ</p>
<h2 id="model-checking-dialog-window">Model-checking: dialog window</h2>
<p>Once the dialog window for model-checking has been opened, the
following options are available:</p>
<h3 id="general-options">General options</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Empty transitions</strong> can be ignored, i.e., there are
not displayed in the R.G. as internal actions</li>
<li>The <strong>search type</strong> can be selected between “BFS” and
“DFS”. BFS means “Breadth-First Search”. It consists in exploring
concurrent branches. In Depth-First search, each branch is first
explored to the end and then concurrent branches are explored. Depending
on the system, it can better to use BFS or DFS. It one technique takes
for a given pragma, do try the other one.</li>
<li>The <strong>word size</strong> states the length of an integer. this
impacts the memory used to store the states of the R.G.</li>
<li>The <strong>maximum number of threads</strong> makes it possible to
limit the load on a machine making it more responsive during the
generation of a R.G. By default, TTool uses the maximum number of
concurrent threads allowed by your system architecture.</li>
<li><strong>Ignore concurrency between internal actions</strong> refers
to the fact that, when two actions a1 and a2 are possible between two
blocks, the model-checker tries to execute a1 and then a2, but also a2
then a1. In case this option is selected, only one out of the two
possibilities is analyzed by the model-checker.</li>
<li><strong>Limit number of states</strong> makes it possible to specify
a number of states after which the R.G. generation stops. Beware, in
that case, the graph could be incomplete.</li>
<li><strong>Time constraint for RG generation</strong> puts a timeout on
the graph generation after which the generation is stopped. Beware, in
that case, the graph could be incomplete.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="basic-properties">Basic properties</h3>
<p>Basic properties refer to deadlocks, reinitialization, loops of
internal actions, reachability of states in state machines, and liveness
of states in state machines. - <strong>Deadlocks</strong> refers to the
fact that from at least on state of the RG, there is no output
transition to another state. - <strong>Reinitialization</strong> means
that from any state of the RG, it is possible to go back to the initial
state of the R. - <strong>Internal action loops</strong> means that
there exists at least one loop in the graph with only internal actions.
- <strong>Reachability</strong> studies, if selected, either for
selected states of states machines or for all states of states machines,
whether there exists at least one path for each of these states from the
initial state of the RG. - <strong>Liveness</strong> means that, for
each considered states of state machines, all paths from the initial
state must reach each of them.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-properties">Advanced properties</h3>
<p>Advanced properties refer to <a
href="file://avatarsafetypragmas.html">Safety pragmas</a>. Safety
pragmas can be selected for being verified individually.</p>
<p>It is also possible to generate traces proving either that there are
satisfied or non satisfied. These traces can be obtained as a graph
(“Generate trace (graph format)”) or as a text file (“Generate trace
(TXT format)”) which contains more information than the graph. Traces
are generated in the default directory, and the text area at the bottom
of the dialog window informs users about which trace files have been
generated.</p>
<p>Traces are generated in the following cases, independently from T/F
being at the top of the pragma: - A[]: if the property is not satisfied
- A&lt;&gt;: if the property is not satisfied - E[]: if the property is
satisfied - E&lt;&gt;: if the property is satisfied - “–&gt;”: if the
property is not satisfied</p>
<p>Once generated, traces in graph format are listed in the left tree,
“R. graphs” section.</p>
<h3 id="generating-the-rg">Generating the RG</h3>
<p>It is possible to select if the RG is generated, or not, where it is
generated, and if it is also saved in dotty format. Once generated, RG
are available in the left tree, “R. graphs” section.</p>
<h3 id="starting-the-model-checker">Starting the model-checker</h3>
<p>Just click on the “start” button. This button is activated only if at
least one basic property as been selected, or one pragma has been
selected, or the RG generation has been selected.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-rgs">Working with RGs</h2>
<p>Once an RG has been generated, it is listed in the left tree, section
“R. graphs”. A right click on a RG (or on a trace) offers several
options: - Getting statistics on the graph - Displaying the graph -
Minimizing the graph</p>
<h2 id="displaying-the-graph">Displaying the graph</h2>
<p>An RG is displayed with an external library called “GraphStream”
provided with TTool. A RG can displayed only if its number of states and
transitions is of reasonable size. Usually, more than 500 states or
transitions will make the displaying slow and useless.</p>
<p>The displaying of graphs can be customized using a CSS specification
added to the configuration file of TTool. Below is provided an example
of such a specification. All the CSS directives given in
https://graphstream-project.org/doc/Advanced-Concepts/GraphStream-CSS-Reference/
can be used in this definition.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;RGStyleSheet data=&quot;
node {fill-color: #B1CAF1; text-color: black; size: 20px, 20px; text-size:14;}     
node.deadlock {fill-color: red; text-color: white; size: 20px, 20px; text-size:16;}    
node.init { fill-color: green; text-color: black; size: 20px, 20px; text-size:16;}
edge {text-color: black; shape: cubic-curve; text-size:10;}    
edge.defaultedge {text-size:10; text-color:black;}  
edge.external {text-color:blue; text-size:14; text-offset: -20, -20; text-alignment: along;}&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><em>node.init</em> corresponds to the first node of the graph. Here,
it is colored in green</li>
<li><em>node.deadlock</em> corresponds to nodes with no output
transitions. They are colored in red.</li>
<li><em>node</em> corresponds to other nodes. They are colors with RGB
color “B1CAF1”</li>
<li><em>edge</em> defines the characteristics of the normal edges.</li>
<li>*edge.defaultedge defines the specification of edges with internal
actions, i.e. with no communication action</li>
<li><em>edge.external</em> refers to edges used for communications
between blocks.</li>
</ul>
